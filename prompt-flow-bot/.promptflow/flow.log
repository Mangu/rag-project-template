b. If bradycardia, consider atropine 1 mg IV/IO, if indicated
c. If no response to fluids (SBP<80 and decreased LOC), administer EPINEPHrine 20 mcg
0.01 mg/mL EPINEPHrine 0.02mg of 0.01mg/mL EPINEPHrine slow IV push (prepared by adding
0.1mg (1mL) of 0.1mg/mL EPINEPHrine to 9mL of saline/flush)EPINEPHrine or DOPAmine
infusion by appropriate protocol or medical command order
3. Airway – if considering advanced airway, consider high-flow NC oxygen at 15 LPM using a
second oxygen tank if attempting advanced airway, consider applying a nasal cannula with 15
LPM oxygen to maintain an appropriate SpO2.
D. Actions within First 20 Minutes1,2:
1. Re-assess response to treatments
2. Circulation – continue fluids/vasopressors (push dose or infusion) as indicated by appropriate
protocol or medical command order
3. Airway – insert advanced airway if indicated
E. Once critical actions have been completed, move the patient to ambulance for transport.
Notes:
1. The specific lengths of time listed are approximate to provide a sense of urgency and to prioritize
actions. Provider safety is of utmost importance. Care for these patients should be given as quickly
as possible, but safety considerations and the scene environment may lead to times that are longer
than these stated goals. When conditions make it impossible to meet these goals, the reasons
should be documented.
2. Actions listed should be simultaneous and not in any specific order.
3. Follow appropriate shock protocol for push dose EPINEPHrine. 0.01 mg/mL (prepared by mixing 1
mL of 0.1 mg/mL diluted with 9 mL NSS) EPINEPHrine 0.02mg of 0.01mg/mL EPINEPHrine slow IV

4. Symptomatic patients with end tidal capnography reading greater than 50mmHg may suggest
impending respiratory failure. End tidal capnography readings less than 30mmHg in symptomatic
patients may suggest shock.
Performance Parameters:
1. Review all cases of cardiac arrest witnessed by (in presence of) EMS providers for compliance with
this protocol to prevent patient deterioration.
2. Ensure that specific treatments also follow other appropriate protocols, e.g. Airway Management,
Shock, Tachycardia, Bradycardia, etc.

For asymptomatic ingestions that may not require transport
Consider contacting Poison Control Center, for stable patient 3,4
Initiate IV/IO NSS KVO
if patient has symptoms
(if hypotensive, follow Shock
Protocol #7005)
If mental status changes,
check blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia
per Altered Level of Consciousness Protocol #7002A or
#7002P
Contact Medical Command
INHALED TOXINS
REMOVE PATIENT FROM ENVIRONMENT
Administer High-flow oxygen and ventilate with BVM, if needed
Intubate, if indicated
Initiate IV/IO NSS KVO
(if hypotensive, follow Shock Protocol #7005)
Monitor ECG and
Pulse Oximetry, if available
WARNING:
Pulse Oximetry monitors give false readings in patients that have been exposed to carbon
monoxide, cyanide, or drugs/ chemicals that may cause methemoglobinemia.
Use 100% oxygen in these patients regardless of Pulse Oximetry reading.
Contact Medical Command
Consider transport to facility with hyperbaric oxygen,
if patient has suspected carbon monoxide exposure and has altered mental status or is
pregnant.
May be appropriate if time to hyperbaric facility is within 30 minutes of time to closest
facility and patient is deemed stable for the longer transport.
